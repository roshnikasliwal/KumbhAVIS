## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#294382), evoking a sense of authority, security, and calm for high-pressure situations. Dark scheme.
- Background color: Desaturated dark blue-gray (#2B3035). A grounding backdrop to provide enough contrast for legibility, while receding into the background so key details pop.
- Accent color: Alert red (#F24B4B). Emphasizes safety alerts and critical actions to grab the user's attention urgently.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look that ensures readability of critical information.
- Use sharp, geometric icons to represent alerts, zones, and data points. Use a red fill for warning icons, and white fill for informational icons.
- A clear layout that can present various real-time streams simultaneously in different panes, with key data clearly visible and customizable by the user.
- Subtle transitions and animations to update data smoothly without overwhelming the user. Use scaling and color change to highlight high-priority data points.

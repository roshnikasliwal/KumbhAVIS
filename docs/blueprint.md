- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, creates a balance of modern readability and technological feel.
- Use a set of consistent, simple icons from a library like Material Design Icons, to represent different types of events, locations, and controls.
